# Project Overview
This repository contains an supervised machine learning to predict employee turnover using pipeline method. The project is designed to help understanding what factors that make employee leave the company

# Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

# File Description

Employee.csv = Dataset of this project
TurnoverPrediction.ipynb = Jupyter Notebook containing the code used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training & evaluation and model improvement.
TurnoverPrediction_inf.ipynb = Jupyter Notebook containing the code for model inference testing.
Deployment(Folder) = Folder containing the code for model deployment.

# Result

Employe Turnover project was able to successfully classify the employee turnover with 89% Train Precision Score and 84% Test Prescision, overall the model is good fit.
